Course projects for the UCLA course "Introduction to Computer Science II"

[Evaluate Infix Expression](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Evaluate%20Infix%20Expression): Given an infix expression, convert the expression to postfix form and compute its computation result using a stack data structure.

[Maze_Solver](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Maze%20Solver): Given a matrix-like maze with ```X``` resembling walls and ```.``` resembling walkable paths, find a valid path through the maze using the following search strategies: depth-first with a stack, breadth-first search with a queue, and recursion. Compare the efficiency of each search method.

[Send_Alerts_via_Various_Mediums](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Send%20Alerts%20via%20Medium): Use inheritance to generate base and derived classes that represent various forms of digital communication (e.g. phone calls, texts, emails, Twitter), and use those communication messages to deliver messages to the command line.

[Sequences](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Sequence): Create a sequence of items of a user-defined data type using the following implementations: dynamically allocated arrays and circularly linked lists.

[Diff_File_Generator_and_Patcher](https://github.com/ankushbharadwaj/UCLA-CS-32/tree/master/Diff%20File%20Creator): Design and implement a hash table and an associated hash function to generate a diff file, given the original and revised files. Also, patch the original file to generate the revised file, given the original file and the diff file.
