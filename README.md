# Object-Oriented-Programming-2
Course projects for the UCLA course "Introduction to Computer Science II". All projects were implemented in C++.

[Macala Board Game with AI Opponent](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/projects/project_3): Implement a virtual macala board game that can be played on the command line. Also, design a strategic AI player that uses a min-max algorithm and outcome-prediction heuristics to search a game tree and select the most advantageous play.

[Diff File Generator and Patcher](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/projects/project_4): Design and implement a hash table and an associated hash function to generate a diff file, given the original and revised files. Also, patch the original file to generate the revised file, given the original file and the diff file.

[Sequences](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/projects/Project%202): Create a sequence of items of a user-defined data type using the following implementations: dynamically allocated arrays and circularly linked lists. Also, implement a variety of operations that can be performed on those sequences (e.g. set the value at an index, get the value at an index, remove an item, insert an item, find an item, return the size, pop and item, push an item, swap the items at the given indices, etc). In a separate [asignment](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/homework/homework_1), the same task was completed using the following implementations: arrays and dynamically allocated arrays.

[Maze Solver](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/homework/homework_2): Given a matrix-like maze with ```X``` resembling walls and ```.``` resembling walkable paths, find a valid path through the maze using the following search strategies: depth-first with a stack, breadth-first search with a queue, and recursion. Compare the efficiency of each search method.

[Send Alerts via Various Mediums](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/homework/homework_3): Use inheritance to generate base and derived classes that represent various forms of digital communication (e.g. phone calls, texts, emails, Twitter), and use those communication messages to deliver messages to the command line.

[Evaluate Infix Expression](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/homework/homework_2): Given an infix expression, convert the expression to postfix form and compute its computation result using a stack data structure.

[Zombie Board Game](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_2/tree/master/projects/Project%201): Implement a virtual board game that can be played on the command line. The user controls a player as he attempts to avoid zombies and navigate to the endpoint.
